	<p><i>Mommy says,</i> it's possible for your baby to sleep throughout the night, only having to wake up once to feed. Every baby can be different, but why not give this a try, you have nothing to lose. Carving out a <strong><i>WINDOW</strong></i> is key!</p>
	<p>Sticking to a schedule from the very beginning is very important.</p>

	<p><i>Mommy says,</i> Hemorrhoids are a real thing (sad face). You're definitely not alone.</p>
	<p>We're going to give coconut oil a try for this one, <u>will keep you updated.</u></p>
	<p><b>Update 2/23/22</b>, Mommy has had a better time with this now, no longer have the lovely hemorrhoid.</p>

	<p><i>Daddy says,</i> Josué, today was doctor day which meant <b>shots</b> :( so this meant only thing afterwards....BATHHH time with your daddy. Today was the first time I felt your love. As we layed in the bath water, your eyes looked into mine as if we both knew what you meant to me. Your gaze into mine made me proud to call myself your father and you my son. I love you son.</p>

	<p><i>Daddy says,</i> today we're giving it another attemp at this blog. I'm actually having a hard time getting the 'box sizing' property to apply only to the slideshow container, when I write it into our CSS it applies it universally. Sad face :/
	I think I really suck at all of this programming stuff but must be in denial because I keep trying. Ahhh...just one of those nights in my head I guess. Love you Josué.</p>

	<p><i>Daddy says,</i> this morning I woke up, had some coffee &#9749; got myself to work for a few hours while my beautiful family rested. You woke up your momma with your morning happy yells (: and our day as a family began. You were fussying for breakfast and didn't want to eat the baby cereal mixed with strawberry and banana that your <i>momma</i> made you, so toast with avocado it was.</p><p>We took off for a drive like we love to do. We dropped off a package with your Uncle George at the barbershop then headed on our journey. I love the inner Roseville/Rocklin/Folsom areas but would indeed feel out of place if I'm being honest with myself. Momma and I had dinner at Amy's in Roseville then headed on home, it's bedtime for Joshua. Daddy is now out back enjoying a fire <b>alone</b> because momma doesn't like being outside in the cold &#128557;. I am starting to do some Google cloud studying though so it's alright. Goodnight Josué.</p>

	<p><i>Daddy says,</i> last night we found out how much you loved the ruffling of papers, this was the first time momma and I heard you laugh like that. Tomorrow we are going to have some company, BBQ & BON FIRE TIME! This week has been pretty chill, the one exciting event that occured is I got notified rent was going up, times of inflation unfortunately. Love you Josué.</p>
