    <h1>To My Wife,</h1>
    <p> I have always been quiet, never much of a talker. It is said that we carry the chains passed on from our prior generations, that is the payment for not turning to God. I have been for some time now, trying to understand what that is. 
        When I was maybe 7, lust came into my heart. I was sat on it's lap. This wasn't something that I looked for, it wasn't something that I even knew what it was. I just felt it. 
        I'll never forget the emotion of that feeling. The weakness for the opposite sex. I can say that I truly believe to my core this was the start of my path toward self destruction. 
        <br/><br/>"For the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth" (Genesis 8:21)
        I lived throughout elementary school with thoughts never actions but thoughts. I never spoke I have always kept everything inside. This made me weak, I have always had weaknesses. 
        "Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak" (Matthew 26:41)<br/><br/>
        Throughout my childhood at times I felt fatherless, I may be wrong for speaking this but that is how I came to feel growing up. My mother acted as both a lot of my life. 
        I never knew that what I have always needed is salvation, to my poor wisdom I always thought I could handle everything alone. This is simply not true, I know that now. 
        I have always had a weakness toward the outside world, my heart had muddy desires. I have walked amongst this earth and have encountered heinous experiences. I wish I could go back and turn around many things but becoming the person I am today must've needed to go through such things. 
        I can't tell you why I had evil in my heart, why I desired so many wrongful things for so long, all I can say is I am longing to be washed away of those burdens. I have never meant for anyone else to get hurt with my actions, in my mind they were actions I was committing, but as one does, others hurt. 
        
        At around age 8 or 9, my mom used to watch novelas, the tv was on all of the time. One night like any other night, a novela was on tv and there was a woman on this show, I got this very strong desire, I am not sure where it came from but I started to kiss and make out with the tv screen. What stopped me was my mom coming back into the living room and yelling at me. She said she would tell my dad and I cried and said sorry, then I don't remember ever speaking about it again. 
        I'd always get these desires, as I grew older I guess I thought this was normal, being a boy. I have learned this is not normal. It's wickedness. <br/><br/>
        I have had weaknesses most of my life. <br/><br/> I can say that since 8th grade my life changed. Since that time my life has been a trajectory of bad. I wish I would’ve had somebody to turn to, a father to teach me. 
        I think since then I have always been in search for an authority figure, I have always longed to have the feeling of safe. This has taken me to dark places. <br/><br/>
        I had a girlfriend in 7th grade she was in 8th grade, a lot of firsts, went all year long. Then one day, I met a friend of hers, never knew she had, we met and moved on with my life never spoke again. Shortly thereafter one summer day I received a text from an unknown number, it was her. I never thought anything of it. I’ve always thought I could handle things on my own. She put candy in my ear, it fed into the evil in my heart. I broke up with my girlfriend. This took me into 8th grade. 
        First week of 8th grade, I am standing outside of my house with my dog, a person comes over to me, a person I knew, and she initiates my weakness. When her older brother walks by and sees us, the following night the cops show up at my door and I’m placed in the back of a police car. That ride to the station, that interrogation room was so cold, the memory of feeling so cold, lonely, and afraid. I locked myself away at home for days, I was scared. I didn’t do any harm to justify what was done to me. I let that go as time went on, I get reminders because it’s my record but they’re just reminders, flashes of how to teach my son. To teach self-control.
        8th grade was a hard year, I started to try and hang out with people I never should have. I was never accepted because that’s not who I truly was, but I kept trying. I had one friend, Jesus, he lived in both worlds. He had a home, a family, he was a bit tougher. He was a mean friend; he wasn’t a good friend. He’d make me feel belittled in public. I felt that authority from him, I guess that’s why I tried so hard to be his friend, to try and feel accepted. Why couldn’t of my dad known these things, why couldn’t he have saved me. This was the only friend I had. 
        This friendship led to a destruction of a part of me. 
        I had oral acts performed on me. I became so numb. I was abused. 
        I became addicted to porn in the summer of my 8th grade.</p>
